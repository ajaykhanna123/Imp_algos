Case 1: When one of ACI is running and next operations takes place using other ACI


1.Make a dumpy variable temp and store actual list of files
2.loop-- condition - if temp list is not empty and active aci is greater than zero
    1.check if any aci is already being killed or not
        if Yes - substract killed ACIs from active_aci variable
        if no - then active_aci value is same as declared earlier
    2. check  length of temp list
        if less than active_aci then apply operations on whole length of temp list and pop indexs on which operation is performed
        if greater than active_aci then apply operation on length of active_aci and pop index on which operation is performed


3. These operations in  loop are executed until length of temp list is zero



Case 2:

1.Make a dumpy variable temp and store actual list of files
2.loop-- condition - if temp list is not empty and active aci is greater than zero
    1.check if any aci is already being killed or not
        if Yes - Stop or pause the next operation until all ACI are not running
        if no -   Continue with next operation
    2. check  length of temp list
        if less than active_aci then apply operations on whole length of temp list and pop indexes on which operation is performed
        if greater than active_aci then apply operation on length of active_aci and pop index on which operation is performed


3. These operations in  loop are executed until length of temp list is zero
